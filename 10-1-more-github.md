What makes github so useful?
----------------------------

- **Forking** -- copy a project and work on it without stomping on the
  creator's toes.
- **Pull requests** -- ask a project maintainer to accept your changes.
- **Easy to read diffs and history** -- including ability to comment on
  changes.
