Enter Git
----------------

- "Version control" software created by Linus Torvalds, creator of
  Linux, in 2005, after getting screwed by their (not-open-source) (but
also awesome) version control system.
- Open source developers need to coordinate 1 - 1000s of developers
  working on projects that could be around for decades.
- Linus' git goals:
    - Not CVS (Concurrent Versions System)
    - Distributed (no need for central server)
    - Safeguards against data corruption
    - Fast
